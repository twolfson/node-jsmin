- alternatively, we can return to master and just track theAIndex along side theA every time it is changed
- then instead of doing console.log(theA), we console.log(file.charAt(theAIndex));
-- this loses abstraction of OOP but saves us the PITA that we are receiving from the Pointer model =(

-- btw we should move back to Crockford's model. no need for these levels etc.
-- maybe the important comments though =/
